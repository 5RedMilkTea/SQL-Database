/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Delete Function

        -Implemented:   SQL DATABASE - SELECT, CREATE/MAKE, INSERT INTO, DROP

        -Partly implemented:

    Bugs     : Some > or < are off by one in very specific situations where the
            key is not there. Not enough time to test heavily

    Reflections: What is sleep? This project is still needs to be polished with
                the functions it is already implementing. Ofc, its no where
                near a complete SQL database but it is working with the
                functions it is implementing. CODE IS NOT OPTIMAL. I do use
                a double for loop to print and filter columns of a table. I
                ran out of time.
